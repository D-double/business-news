# BUSINESS NEWS

This project was created to train students on Bootstrap v4.4.1. During my studies I taught:
+ downloading custom fonts,
+ using css variables,
+ naming classes according to the BEM methodology,
+ creating anchor links and url protocols,
+ columnar layout and adaptation to different browser screens using bootstrap classes,
+ adding and changing bootstrap components (Navbar, Carousel, Accordion, Tabs).
